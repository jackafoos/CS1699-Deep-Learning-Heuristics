# CS1699-Deep-Learning-Heuristics
* 50 node graphs, symmetric matrix, undirected

## Data (Initial Numbers)
  * Training set: 10,000
    * Training: 9,000
    * Validation: 1,000
  * Test Set: 4,000

## Heuristics:
  * Nearest Neighbor
  * Greedy
  * Christofides
  * Nearest Insertion

## For Data Generation:
  * Diagonal is zeros
  * symmetric matrix
  * -1 for not connected
  * Otherwise 1 < n < 100
